# boolean3

Original code of `boolean2` module is developed by Albert. Original code can be downloaded by following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/ialbert/booleannet.git
```

As original code is excuted only from `python2`, I translated the code by using `2to3.py` and updated version of `ply`. 

Ply can be downloaded from following link:
